# Simple test if Inquirer runs on Bun

Looks like yes.

We're using `@inquirer/prompts` library, which is the newest version of Inquirer.

## How to run

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.18. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
